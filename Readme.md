## Goal

This repo is an attempt to isolate the gtk code used in the red/GTK branch and insert more easily in the red/master branch.


## TODO

1. visiting modules/view/backends/platform.red: 
	* it seems that `gui/post-quit-message` needs to be developped... but this is not sure
	* `set fonts` needs to be specified for Linux???
