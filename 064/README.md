## To update

### Files to update in master branch

* `./update_master_folder_from_source.sh` updates `master` folder from `../master/red` containing last files of red/master branch
* `git status` shows if some files have changed in master
* These files need to be updated in `gtk3` folder

### Files specific to gtk branch

These files can simply be copied in the developping a folder containing `red:master` branch. If `<red-folder>` is the name of this folder, `./update_github_red_GTK.sh <red-folder>` will update the folder with the GTK tools.
